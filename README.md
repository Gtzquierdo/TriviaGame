**Trivia Game**

A fun basic 4 question Trivia Game. The theme is based around my favorite NBA team and Colorado sports team....**The Denver Nuggets**

**No User-Input Needed**
**30 Seconds to Answer**
Simple Instructions:

1. One question will appear and it'll stay on the screen until the player answers it or the time runs out. 
2. If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulating them will appear. After a few seconds the next question will appear.
3. The scenario for the wrong answers and time-outs go as follow:
  1. If player runs out of time, it'll tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Few seconds will pass and the next question will appear.
  2.  If player chooses wrong answer, it'll tell the player that they selected the wrong option and the display will appear. Next question will appear a few seconds later. 
 4. On the final screen, you'll see the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game.
 
 *Future development of this game will be to have a more appealing User Interface.*
